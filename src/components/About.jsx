        Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Anthony and I'm a skilled software engineer with
        years of experience. I've worked with both frontend frameworks like
        ReactJS, and NextJS but I've also spent a good portion developing on the
        backend with languages like Python, Java, and Go. I'm always interested
        in solving difficult problems and welcome all collaboration.
